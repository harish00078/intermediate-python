# Logging is used to tracking events that occur when the software runs. This module is widely used by the developers when they work to logging.
# this is used to tell me why my software will crash ( this will show me through logggings ) 
# Logging is important for software developing, debugging, and running. If you donâ€™t have any logging record and your program crashes, there are very few chances that you detect the cause of the problem. And if you detect the cause, it will consume a lot of time.that why we use the logging module to easily find out the problem in the software
