# a = 5 + '10' #  add int in string error

# from logging import exception
# import somemodule # this error beacuse we did not define that wwhich module we want to import

# a =5
# b= c # this is name error or variable do not found error 

# f = open('somefile.txt') # file not found error

# a = [1,2,3]
# a.remove(4) # this is value error ( in this example we donot have a 4 that why this will throw a value error)
# print(a)



# a = [1,2,3]
# a[4] # this is index error ( in this example we donot have a 4 that why this will throw a index error)
# print(list(a))
